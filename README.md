## Why Java fx?

You can build your own scene.<br/>
Develop your own system application.

## Scene Builder

The WYSIWYG drag-n-drop design tool for JavaFx will build an FXML representation of
the UI which can then be loaded by a JavaFx application.  
Scene Builder helps to enforce the MVC pattern, 
keeping business logic out of the code that describes the UI.

WYSIWYG = What you see is what you get
UI = User InterFace
MVC = Model View Controller

Finally, MvvmFX is a framework for implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in JavaFX.
